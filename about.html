        Artistic History:
    </h3>

    <p > <!-- About my lifelong love and struggle to make art.-->
        I have loved art for as long as I can remember. When I was a kid all I would ask for, for Christmas was art and craft supplies. I 
        took art as soon as it was an option in Grade 7 up to grade 12.  But more recently it has been a constant cycle of 
        <i>hyperfocusing</i> on some creative craft for a week, only to fall off and not touch it again for months.  This has been a real struggle 
        for me, because I want nothing more to improve and refine my craft, but I get frustrated at my lack of quick progress only to just quit.
    </p>

        Some of my the creative mediums I use are:

                (Originally I just had an image of each artist here that was linked to the artists spotify, that also had a super cool hover ability that showed the artists name, but since I would have to cite the photos I just decided to remove them :...D I will comment the code just so you see what I had)
