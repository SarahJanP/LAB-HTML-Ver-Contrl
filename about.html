    <h3> 
        Artistic History:
    </h3>

    <p> 
        I have loved art for as long as I can remember, when I was a kid all I would ask for Christmas was art and craft supplies, I 
        took art as soon as it was an option in Grade 7 up to grade 12.  I have always loved art but it has been a constant cycle of 
        <i>hyperfocusing</i> on some creative craft for a week, only to fall off and not touch it again for months.  This has been a real struggle 
        for me, because I want nothing more to improve and refine my craft, but I get frustrated at my lack of quick progress only to just quit.

    <p>
        Some of my creative mediums are:
    </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Painting</li>
            <li> Sketching</li>
            <li> Crochet </li>
            <li> Collage </li>
            <li> Photography </li>
        </ul>

                (Originally I just had an image of each artist here that was linked to the artists spotify, that also had a super cool hover ability that showed the artists name, but since I would have to cite the photos I just decided to remove them :...D I will comment the code just so you see what I had)
