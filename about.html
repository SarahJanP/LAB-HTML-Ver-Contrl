    <h2> Artist History:</h2>  <!-- Remove padding between Fammiliy and Information.-->
    <p> I have loved art for as long as I can remember, when I was a kid all I would ask for Christmas was art and craft supplies, I </br>
        took art as soon as it was an option in Grade 7 up to grade 12.  I have always loved art but it has been a constant cycle of </br>
        <b>hyperfocusing</b> on some creative craft for a week, only to fall off and not touch it again for months.  This has been a real struggle </br>
        for me, because I want nothing more to improve and refine my craft, but I get frustrated at my lack of quick progress only to just quit.
