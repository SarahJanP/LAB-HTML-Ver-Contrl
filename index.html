      Hello, welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Sarah, and I am a first year Interactive Design: User Experience 
      Major at SAIT and I am enjoying it so much, and I am learning even more.
    </p>


    <p> The <i>5 Goals</i> that I want to keep in mind while attending SAIT are:</p>
      <ol> 
        <li> Maintain good sleep habits </li>
        <li> Be excited to learn new things, and try not to get discouraged when challenged.</li>
        <li> Do my best every day, whatever that looks like.</li>
        <li> Make time for myself and my hobbies.</li>
        <li> Try to make new connections wherever possible.</li>
      </ol>

    <p>

            <summary > <strong>Click</strong> to learn more about my Educational Background. </summary>
            <p >  
              I have struggled for a long time in figuring out what it is that I really want to do in life, 
              and I have tried a number of different programs since graduating in 2020 at different post secondary schools while trying to figure that out.  
              I studied Chemistry for a year at Mount Royal University, Computer Science for a year at the University of Calgary, and now Interactive Design at SAIT.
              I finally feel like I have found the program that feels right for me
