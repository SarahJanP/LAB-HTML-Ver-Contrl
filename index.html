    <p>
      Hello, welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Sarah, and I am a first year Interactive Design: User Experience 
      Major at SAIT and I am learning so many interesting things! I can't wait to continue to grow as a designer.
    </p>


    <p> The <i>5 Goals</i> that I want to keep in mind while attending SAIT are:</p>
      <ol> 
        <li> Maintain good sleep habits </li>
        <li> Be excited to learn new things, and try not to get discouraged when challenged.</li>
        <li> Do my best every day, whatever that looks like.</li>
        <li> Make time for myself and my hobbies.</li>
        <li> Try to make new connections wherever possible.</li>
      </ol>

        </summary>
          I have struggled for a long time in figuring out what it is that I really want to do in life, 
          and since graduating in 2020 I have tried a number of different programs at different post secondary schools.  
          I studied Chemistry for a year at Mount Royal University, Computer Science for a year at the University of Calgary, and now Interactive Design at SAIT.
          And it finally feels like I have found the program that I'm actually excited about.
