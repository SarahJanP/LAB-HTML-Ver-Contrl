        <summary ><strong>Click</strong> to learn more about my Educational Background. </summary>
          I have struggled for a long time in figuring out what it is that I really want to do in life, 
          and since graduating in 2020 I have tried a number of different programs at different post secondary schools.  
          I studied Chemistry for a year at Mount Royal University, Computer Science for a year at the University of Calgary, and now Interactive Design at SAIT.
          And it finally feels like I have found the program that I'm actually excited about.
